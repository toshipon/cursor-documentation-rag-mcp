# Docker Environment Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Docker Environment Setup
- [x] Created Dockerfile with optimizations for Python, system dependencies, and health checks
- [x] Created entrypoint.sh script with command routing logic and model download handling
- [x] Created docker-compose.yml for multi-container deployment
- [x] Added environment variables (.env) for configuring container resources
- [x] Added resource constraints for memory management
- [x] Created run_docker.sh for easy deployment and testing

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Added caching for query results using TTLCache
- [x] Added caching for embeddings using LRUCache
- [x] Implemented batch query processing for higher throughput
- [x] Added thread-safe singleton pattern for embedder and database connections
- [x] Configured gunicorn with uvicorn workers for better concurrency
- [x] Added Python optimization flags for better performance
- [x] Added background tasks for non-blocking operations

### MCP Server Improvements
- [x] Added enhanced filtering capabilities with JSON metadata support
- [x] Added batch query endpoint for processing multiple queries
- [x] Added caching layer with configurable TTL
- [x] Improved error handling and logging
- [x] Added health check endpoint with Docker health check integration
- [x] Added extended statistics endpoint with cache metrics

### Documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with Docker setup instructions
- [x] Added API documentation
- [x] Created Docker-specific README
- [x] Added environment variable documentation

## Next Steps

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create integration tests for Docker environment
- [ ] Validate resource constraints and adjust as needed
- [ ] Perform load testing to ensure performance under high query volume
- [ ] Test GPU acceleration integration (if applicable)

### Additional Features
- [ ] Add support for incremental updates to vector database
- [ ] Implement vector database sharding for larger datasets
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboards with Prometheus/Grafana
- [ ] Implement user authentication and API keys
